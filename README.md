# pandas-challenge

I completed the Module 4 Pandas-Challenge using the following methods:
1) Group Study with Victoria Martin, Mia Hursh, Kiet, Patrick Dean, Chau Nyguen
2) Tutor, Kuort, provided through the EdX program
3) Class TA and Teacher
4) Virtual Assistant

SUMMARY:
The results of this data analysis demonstrate the impact between school size, school type, and spending per student as they relate to the overall passing percentages of the students throughout the district.  Interestingly, the data demonstrated that spending per student did not have the outcome that may have been expected.  The highest performing schools tended to have lower per student spending. In fact, the best performing school in the district was one of four schools with <$585 per student spending. Johnson High School was the worst performing school in the district but had the third highest per student budget at $650.

The bottom performing schools within the district had the largest number of students, greatest budget per student, and were all district school types. In comparison, the highest performing schools had smaller numbers of students, lower budgets per student, and were all charter school types. The Charter Schools had an Overall Passing Percent of 90% and the District Schools had an Overall Passing Percent of 53%.  The Charter Schools were among the top 5 highest performing schools in the district and District Schools were the bottom 5 performing schools based on overall passing percentage.

In summary, the Charter Schools outperformed the District Schools based on Overall Passing Percent for math and reading.  A next step for the school district could be to collect information about teacher experience and training, class size, Principal experience and training, and further analysis about how the money is spent in the Per Student Budget.
